# Peregrine falcon Watcher #

This project is a motion detection, object counting program that counts birds in infrared camera videos.
It has been made as a part of a conservation project, and is free to use for educational and non-profit purposes

## How it works ##
This program uses various open-cv packages to find and track birds in the sky.  It uses a bird object, and positioning and track and count individual birds
to get a resonably accurate assessment of the number of birds in a video.  It then output the birds and their time stamps as a tab delimited txt document.
